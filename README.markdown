ioMediaPlugin
=============

Work in progress.

A very simple way to centralize media assets with admin management.

There are several plugins doing a similar job, including
lyMediaManagerPlugin and several others that predate it. This plugin attempts
to be simpler - bringing in less to your project in a more decoupled manner.
